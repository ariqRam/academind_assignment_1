# academind_assignment_1

This is the project I created as a submission for the Academind Flutter course #1 assignment on Udemy. The task was to  :
1. Create a new Flutter App (flutter create flutter_assignment,
then replace your main.dart with the attached one)
// and output an AppBar and some text below it (i.e. in the body of the page)
2. Add a button (e.g. RaisedButton) which changes the text (to any other text of your choice)
3. Split the app into three custom widgets: App, TextControl & Text

## Hellos App

The app I created is an app that shows the word "Hello" from 10 different languages. This idea is the modification of the TextChanger app the assignment asked me to make.

## Details

The app has two buttons that bring the user to the next language of the list. The app's UI is still in the early stage as I'm still learning on Flutter's UI.
